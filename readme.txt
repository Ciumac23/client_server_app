- Sever (single) will be the first component implemented by four of you and will realize the linkage ˆıntre client, ii
from the platform, for the purpose of publishing and subscribing to messages.
- The client, the TCP are the second component. Aces, tia vor fi implementat, i de student, i s, i vor avea urm˘atorul
comportament: un client TCP se conecteaz˘a la server, poate primi (ˆın orice moment) de la tastatur˘a
(interacting with the human user) commands such as subscribe and unsubscribe, and display on the
screen the messages received from the server.
- UDP clients (which will come ready implemented from the theme team)
publish, by sending to four servers, messages to the proposed platform using a predefined protocol.
The desired functionality is that each TCP client receives those messages from the server, coming from
client, ii UDP, which refer to the topics to which they are subscribed, i. The architecture includes a component of SF
(store&foreward) component on messages sent when TCP clients are disconnected.
